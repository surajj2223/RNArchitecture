<h2>A simple React Native Application showing underlying Bridge Communication.</h2>

Clone the code and run in Android as this demonstration code is exclusively for Android.
The concept holds true for iOS too, its just that the custom native modules created for this demo are only created for Android and are missing for iOS at the moment.

You can look at the bridge communication that goes underneath the React Native execution and gain great insights.
